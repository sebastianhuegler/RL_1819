\section{INTRODUCTION}

The increase of computational power in recent years has allowed for the successful implementation of learning algorithms to control a wide range of dynamical systems. Nonetheless, classical approaches to control problems also provide 
useful solutions for this class of systems. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to present and discuss algorithms and results, as well as advantages and drawbacks of different control approaches, namely model-based reinforcement learning (RL), model-free RL, and optimal control. These methods are applied to a spring-mass system, a pendulum, and a cart-pole system.

The algorithms and results for the three approaches are presented in Sec. II, Sec. III, and Sec. IV, while a discussion of the findings is provided in Sec. V and a summarizing conclusion is drawn in Sec. VI.

\section{OPTIMAL CONTROL}
The overarching concept in optimal control is to optimize control inputs and system states according to a specific cost function. 

For linear systems, the method of choice is a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) that optimizes a linear-quadratic (LQ) cost function. When dealing with non-linear systems, LQR can be iteratively applied to locally LQ problems. This method is called iterative LQR (iLQR). Another method to handle non-linear systems is model-predictive control (MPC). In MPC, an optimization problem to obtain optimal inputs and state trajectories is only solved for a finite time horizon and continually updated during runtime.

For this section, LQR was applied to the linear spring-mass system, iLQR to the pendulum, and MPC to the cart-pole system to highlight the different capabilities of these approaches.
\subsection{Algorithms}

The spring-mass system can be described by a system of differential equations
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:JanSMsys}
	\dot{x}=
	\underbrace{
		\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
			0 &1\\
			-\frac{k}{m} &0\end{array} } \right)}_{A}x + 
	\underbrace{
		\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
		0\\
		\frac{1}{m}\end{array} } \right)}_{B}u,
\end{equation}
with the spring constant $k=1$\,N/m and the mass $m=1$\,kg,
while the output of the system is given as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:JanSMoutput}
	y=
	\underbrace{
		(1\quad 0)}_{C}x.
\end{equation}
The continuous LQR aims at minimizing the cost function depicted in (\ref{eqn:JanSMcostfunc}).
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:JanSMcostfunc}
	J_1 = \int^{\infty}_{0} \left(x^{T}Q\,x + u^{T}R\,u\right)dt,
\end{equation}
with weight matrices $Q$ and $R$.
Since there was no specifications for input and states, the weights were simply set to $Q=$ diag$(1,1)$ and $R=0.1$. 
This results in an optimal input $u=-K\,x$ which transforms (1) into
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:JanSMcontrolledSys}
	\dot{x} = (A-B\,K)x.
\end{equation}
For the spring-mass system, $K$ was computed using the Matlab function ``lqr''.

Since the goal position is not the origin but rather $x=(1.5 ~ 0)^T$, a prefilter matrix $L$ as shown in (\ref{eqn:JanSMprefilter}) is necessary.
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:JanSMprefilter}
L = \left(C(B\,K-A)^{-1}B\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
Since LQR is lacking an integral component, a simple PI controller ($K_P=K_I=1$) was added to drive the system into the desired goal position even under disturbances. Note that the system would also be stable for any other controller gain but experience higher overshooting.\\

The iLQR approach for the pendulum was based on [+add reference for Tassa, Mansard and Todorov, 'Control-Limited Differential Dynamic Programming', ICRA 2014+] and their ``iLQG/DDP trajectory optimization'' toolbox for Matlab. 

The dynamics of the system are described in (\ref{eqn:JanPsys}).
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:JanPsys}
\dot{x}=
	\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
		x_2\\
		\tfrac{u \: - \: \,b\,x_2 \: - \: m\,g\,s\sin(x_1)}{m\,s^2}\end{array} } \right),
\end{equation}
with the input $u$, the friction coefficient $b=0.2$\,sNm/rad, the mass $m=1$\,kg, the acceleration of gravity $g=9.82$\,m/s$^2$, and the length of the pendulum $s=1$\,m. To make the problem more interesting, the input is limited to $|u|<4$\,Nm, so that the goal cannot be achieved in a single swing but only by moving back and forth. 

The iLQR (or the similar iLQG) algorithm is a shooting method. This means that an input trajectory is applied to the system (forward pass), and then the input trajectory is optimized (backwards pass). This process is repeated iteratively, until the input trajectory converges.

The cost function for the pendulum problem is defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:JanPcostfunc}
J_2 = \frac{1}{2}\overline{x}_N^{T}P\,\overline{x}_N + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\left(\overline{x}_k^{T}Q\,\overline{x}_k + u_k^{T}R\,u_k\right),
\end{equation}
with the time horizon $N$, the deviation of the current state from the desired state $\overline{x}_k=(x_k-x_{des})$, the final weight matrix $P$, and the familiar $Q$ and $R$ matrices. 

Without any other specifications, the input weight was set to a rather low value of $R=10^{-3}$. 

Even though the desired state is the upright position of the pendulum at zero speed, during the run, only a modest punishment is placed on the correctness of the position to leave enough room for swinging back and forth, and the speed is not punished at all since it is required to drive the pendulum in the desired position. Therefore, this matrix was set to $Q=$ diag$(10^{-3},0)$.

For the final state, the position is the most important factor, while the speed should at least be close to zero, which leads to $P=$ diag$(100,0.1)$.

The iLQR algorithm was set to a time horizon of $N=5000$ at a $t=1$\,ms sample time, which equals a runtime of 5 seconds.

iLQR is an open-loop controller. Therefore, in the implementation, the resulting input trajectory $\underline{u}$ from the optimization was used as feed forward control, while a PID controller minimized the difference between the estimated trajectory $\underline{x}$ (from the optimization) and the actual state.
Without this setup, even the slightest perturbation of the system (e.g. rounding errors) leads to a failed upswing since the goal position is an unstable equilibrium point.\\

The cart-pole dynamics are as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:JanCPsys}
\dot{x}=
\left( {\begin{array}{cc}
	x_2\\
	\frac{2\,m\,l\,x_4^2\,\text{s}_3 \: + \: 3\,m\,g\,\text{s}_3\,\text{c}_3 \: + \: 4(u \: - \: c\,x_2)}{4(M \: + \: m) \: - \: 3\,m\,\text{c}_3^2}\\
	x_4\\
	\frac{-3\,m\,l\,x_4^2\,\text{s}_3\,\text{c}_3 \: - \: 6(M \: + \: m)\,g\,\text{s}_3 \: - \: 6(u \: - \: c\,x_2)\,\text{c}_3}{l(4(M \: + \: m) \: - \: 3\,m\,\text{c}_3^2)}\end{array} } \right),
\end{equation}
with the mass of the pendulum $m=0.2$\,kg, the mass of the cart $M=1$\,kg, the length of the pole $l=0.5$\,m, the acceleration of gravity $g=9.82$\,m/s$^2$, the friction coefficient $c=0.2$\,sN/m, and where s$_3$ and c$_3$ stand for sin$(x_3)$ and cos$(x_3)$, respectively. 

The MPC implementation was based on the ``nmpc'' function from [+cite Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Theory and Algorithms, Grüne, Lars, Pannek, Jürgen +]. This function aggregates system dynamics, constraints, cost function, and optimization parameters to solve the optimization problem with the Matlab function ``fmincon''.

The input was constrained to $|u|<5$\,N, and the cart position was limited to $|x_1|<4$\,m. The cost function is the same as in (\ref{eqn:JanPcostfunc}), with $P=$ diag$(0,10,10,10)$ (end position of the cart is irrelevant as long as it stays within the bounds), $Q=$ diag$(20,10,10,0)$ (cart should remain in the center during upswing, while angular speed is irrelevant), and $R=0.01$. 

The prediction horizon was set to $N=20$ at a sample time of $t=20$\,ms, and the simulation ran for 4 seconds.

Since MPC is a closed-loop control strategy, no additional controller was necessary.
\subsection{Results}

For the spring-mass system without disturbances, the goal was reach by the LQR controller with $K=$. However, with an added constant disturbance of $d=0.5$\,N, the LQR controller alone fails to reach the desired position, while the addition of the PI controller solves this issue as shown in figure (\ref{fig:JanSM}).
\begin{figure}[htp] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{MS.png}
	\caption{Comparison of LQR and LQR+PI controller. Position $x_1$ of the spring-mass system (top) and control input $u$ (bottom).}
	\label{fig:JanSM}
\end{figure} 

Note that only using the PI controller is not sufficient and would cause the system to become unstable.\\

For the pendulum, the iLQR algorithm converged to a cost of 156.70 after 52 iterations. The resulting trajectory is one initial swing to the left, followed by a complete upswing to the right. This trajectory seems reasonable, since reaching the goal with just a single swing is impossible due to the restrictions on the control input. Figure (\ref{fig:JanP1}) displays the trajectory that the algorithm found and the simulated trajectory with an added PID controller.
\begin{figure}[htp] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{P1.png}
	\caption{Comparison of iLQR result and closed-loop simulation. Angular position $x_1$ of the pendulum (top) and control input $u$ (bottom).}
	\label{fig:JanP1}
\end{figure} 

Both trajectories are almost identical, and there is only a small deviation in the control input at the end of the upswing (compare figure (\ref{fig:JanP1}) bottom at 3 seconds). However, this slight change is crucial to keep the pendulum in the upright position. Without the added PID controller, the system remains instable as shown in figure (\ref{fig:JanP2}), since iLQR is not a closed-loop controller.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{P2.png}
	\caption{Comparison of iLQR result and open-loop simulation. Angular position $x_1$ of the pendulum.}
	\label{fig:JanP2}
\end{figure}\\

The MPC controller managed to stabilize the pendulum of the cart-pole in the upright position after 135 time steps or 2.7 seconds. Due to the input constraints, the car had to move left and right a few times to allow the pendulum to swing back and forth until it reached the upright position. The successful swing-up is presented in figure (\ref{fig:JanCP}). 
 \begin{figure}[htp] 
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{CP.png}
 	\caption{The swing-up of the cart-pole system. Angular position $\theta=x_3$ of the pendulum and horizontal displacement $x=x_1$ of the car (top) and control input $u$ (bottom).}
 	\label{fig:JanCP}
 \end{figure}

Since MPC is a closed-loop control strategy, the system remained in the upright position after reaching it initially.
